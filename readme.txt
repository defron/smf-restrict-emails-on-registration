This modification gives the Admin the chance ,to restrict some of E-Mail providers on registration.It will be sometimes useful,because some of users
are complaining about,that they can not get the activation mail and not activate their account.Such E-Mail providers should be restricted 
via that Modification and then your users won't have no more problems with the activation...
